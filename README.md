# PortScanner
A port scanner is a program that automatically detects security weaknesses in a remote or localhost. When hackers attack a site, they often try each port in turn to see which are available and not blocked by a firewall or TCP wrapper. This scan can be recognized by a series of packets from one host to another in a short period of time. Port scans are aimed at many different ports, often in an increasing or decreasing sequence. This project involves the implementation of a port scan detector.

#If you reached till here, you have made it.



Project contain:
I. Acknowledge
II. Documentation.txt: report
III. output.txt: sample output
IV. requirement.txt: environment to be installed
V. Technical analysis: Initial analysis apart from python and interpretation. 


STEPS:

a. Unarchive zip file.

b. locate path to file(cmd/terminal).

c. Run following command:

1. requirements.txt: for creating programming environment.
	-> pip install -r requirements.txt
2. main.py- python file containing code
	-> python main.py test.pcap
	test.pcap can be any file that needs scan and detection.

It should pop up visualization along with result displayed in terminal/cmd.


In case nothing work out
